Challenge 3: Lab 5

We have supported write access for small files upto 40KB in the current disk based file system. These are the sections which we have implemented.

Implemented dev_filewrite in file.c. and serv_write at disk side. We have also generated the test case (user/manoj.c )which writes in the disk based file system and shows what was written.

Run:

make run-manoj
